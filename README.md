# terrible-warnings-and-errors
Do you find Roslyn error and warning messages to be too helpful and yearn for a challenge? Do you want to be made to feel stupid for every mistake you make? This is a VS Code plugin to help with that. 

Leveraging an LLM to generate very unhelpful and even morale destroying translations of the standard Roslyn error and warning descriptions.
